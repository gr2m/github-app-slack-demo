# github-app-slack-demo

A minimal GitHub App that integrates with Slack

## The Plan

1. Create a "Hello, world" GitHub App that runs locally. It should comment on all new issues that have been created.
2. Deploy the app to Netlify.
3. Add a Slack integration that responds to messages with a "Hello, world" reply.
4. Add a slash command creates a bi-directional sync between a slack channel and a github repository. When an issue is posted, create a message in the slack channel. When a message is posted in the slack channel, create an issue in the github repository. Use Supabase for data persistence.
5. Prompt the user to authenticate when creating a bi-directional sync, and user their authentication to create issues.
